
Git history prior to the 1.0 release is kept in the prerelease branch.
Use 'git log prerelease' to see it. 

To recreate the entire history, including prerelease history:

git replace prerelease-here prerelease (if branch names exist)
git replace c3e8c32 fe9391f (if they don't)

Be careful not to commit the combined history, or all benefits of the
split history will be lost!

To undo it:

git replace -d prerelease-here
